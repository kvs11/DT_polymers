This document keeps track of the design ideas that we would try to develop Fantastx_polymers

---------------

GOAL: To get the atomisitic structure of a polymer nanocomposite from the Neutron scattering data --

i.e., S(Q) --> atomic structure
In simple terms, obtain several 'valid' structures and get their S(Q) & compare.

* valid structures --> ones relaxed with LAMMPS --> have ideal distances
---------------

To get valid structures, we need to do -

(1) Structure generation (randomly/GA using FANTASTX)
(2) Structure relaxation (LAMMPS)
(3) Optimize the force field used with LAMMPS.

Currently, 
(1) should be developed. We need to eliminate (2) and get 'valid' structures. 
The parameters in (3) should be left to be solved for by ML models.
--------------

Workflow: 

Loop 1: 

Inputs/Constraints ---> make polymer structures (Random/GA) ---> Get S(Q) & compare

Variables => size, mass fraction and  distribution of NPs; chain length and number of polymers 

Store good structures separately.

Loop 2:

Take good structures & do LAMMPS NPT followed by NVT --> Get S(Q)

Variables => The parameters of the LAMMPS force field.

QQ: How to optimize these force field parameters effectively?
